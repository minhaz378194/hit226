# Sprint 3 – MVP Card Template

## 👕 Project Brief
This project is an online clothing store that allows users to browse, add, and subscribe to updates on fashion items. The final product will include features such as product listings, shopping carts, and user engagement through email subscriptions.

## 💡 Hypothesis
If we design a clean, responsive, and accessible card layout to display clothing items, users will be more likely to interact with the product (e.g., click on buy buttons, view details), improving both engagement and usability.
